 Face Mask Detection System using Raspberry Pi & Arduino

## ðŸ§  Overview

This project implements a real-time **Face Mask Detection and Temperature Screening System** using **Raspberry Pi**, **Arduino**, and **deep learning**. It leverages computer vision to determine if a person is wearing a face mask and checks body temperature using a contactless sensor. Based on the results, it triggers access control mechanisms such as a servo door motor and buzzer alerts.

---

## ðŸ“¸ Features

- Real-time face mask detection using OpenCV and TensorFlow/Keras.
- Lightweight CNN model built on MobileNetV2.
- Serial communication between Raspberry Pi and Arduino for control logic.
- Buzzer alerts for people not wearing masks.
- Automatic door control using a servo motor if mask is detected and temperature is normal.
- Contactless body temperature measurement using MLX90614 IR sensor.
- Compact, deployable system suitable for public spaces like hospitals, banks, offices, and malls.

## ðŸ§ª Setup Instructions

### 1. Raspberry Pi
- Install required packages:
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
- Connect the Pi Camera or USB webcam.
- Download and place the trained model `mask_detector.model` into the project directory.
